Brooks</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why is programming fun? What delights may its practitioner expect as his reward?</strong></p>
<p>First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things,
especially things of his own design. I think this delight must be an image of God's delight in making things,
a delight shown in the distinctness and newness of each leaf and each snowflake.</p>
<p>Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. Deep within, you want others to use your work and
to find it helpful. In this respect the programming system is not essentially different from the child's
first clay pencil holder &quot;for Daddy's office.&quot;</p>
<p>Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them
work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning. The programmed computer
has all the fascination of the pinball machine or the jukebox mechanism, carried to the ultimate.</p>
<p>Fourth is the joy of always learning, which springs from the nonrepeating nature of the task. In one way or another
the problem is ever new, and its solver learns something: sometimes practical, sometimes theoretical, and sometimes both.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable medium. The programmer, like the poet,
works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by the exertion of
the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand
conceptual structures....</p>
<p>Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing
visible outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms.
The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life,
showing things that never were nor could be.</p>
<p>Programming then is fun because it gratifies creative longings built deep within us and delights sensibilities you have in common with all men.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Not all is delight, however, and knowing the inherent woes makes it easier to bear them when they appear.</strong></p>
<p>First, one must perform perfectly. The computer resembles the magic of legend in this respect, too. If one character,
one pause, of the incantation is not strictly in proper form, the magic doesn't work. Human beings are not accustomed to being perfect,
and few areas of human activity demand it. Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program.</p>
<p>Next, other people set one's objectives, provide one's resources, and furnish one's information. One rarely controls the
circumstances of his work, or even its goal. In management terms, one's authority is not sufficient for his responsibility.
It seems that in all fields, however, the jobs where things get done never have formal authority commensurate with responsibility.
In practice, actual (as opposed to formal) authority is acquired from the very momentum of accomplishment.</p>
<p>The dependence upon others has a particular case that is especially painful for the system programmer. He depends upon other
people's programs. These are often maldesigned, poorly implemented, incompletely delivered (no source code or test cases),
and poorly documented. So he must spend hours studying and fixing things that in an ideal world would be complete, available, and usable.</p>
<p>The next woe is that designing grand concepts is fun; finding nitty little bugs is just work. With any creative activity
come dreary hours of tedious, painstaking labor, and programming is no exception.</p>
<p>Next, one finds that debugging has a linear convergence, or worse, where one somehow expects a quadratic sort of approach to the end.
So testing drags on and on, the last difficult bugs taking more time to find than the first.</p>
<p>The last woe, and sometimes the last straw, is that the product over which one has labored so long appears to be
obsolete upon (or before) completion. Already colleagues and competitors are in hot pursuit of new and better ideas.
Already the displacement of one's thought-child is not only conceived, but scheduled.</p>
<p>This always seems worse than it really is. The new and better product is generally not available when one completes his own;
it is only talked about. It, too, will require months of development. The real tiger is never a match for the paper one,
unless actual use is wanted. Then the virtues of reality have a satisfaction all their own.</p>
<p>Of course the technological base on which one builds is always advancing. As soon as one freezes a design,
it becomes obsolete in terms of its concepts. But implementation of real products demands phasing and quantizing.
The obsolescence of an implementation must be measured against other existing implementations, not against unrealized concepts.
The challenge and the mission are to find real solutions to real problems on actual schedules with available resources.</p>
<p>This then is programming, both a tar pit in which many efforts have floundered and a creative activity with joys
and woes all its own. For many, the joys far outweigh the woes....</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a <em>programming paradigm</em>.</strong> A programming paradigm guides programmers to analyze programming problems, and structure programming solutions, in a specific way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Programming languages have traditionally divided the world into two parts—data and operations on data. Data is static and immutable, except as the operations may change it. The procedures and functions that operate on data have no lasting state of their own; they’re useful only in their ability to affect data.</p>
<p>This division is, of course, grounded in the way computers work, so it’s not one that you can easily ignore or push aside. Like the equally pervasive distinctions between matter and energy and between nouns and verbs, it forms the background against which you work. At some point, all programmers—even object-oriented programmers—must lay out the data structures that their programs will use and define the functions that will act on the data.</p>
<p>With a procedural programming language like C, that’s about all there is to it. The language may offer various kinds of support for organizing data and functions, but it won’t divide the world any differently. Functions and data structures are the basic elements of design.</p>
<p>Object-oriented programming doesn’t so much dispute this view of the world as restructure it at a higher level. It groups operations and data into modular units called objects and lets you combine objects into structured networks to form a complete program. In an object-oriented programming language, objects and object interactions are the basic elements of design.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every object has both state (data) and behavior (operations on data). In that, they’re not much different
from ordinary physical objects. It’s easy to see how a mechanical device, such as a pocket watch or a piano,
embodies both state and behavior. But almost anything that’s designed to do a job does, too. Even simple things
with no moving parts such as an ordinary bottle combine state (how full the bottle is, whether or not it’s open,
how warm its contents are) with behavior (the ability to dispense its contents at various flow rates, to be opened
or closed, to withstand high or low temperatures).</p>
<p>It’s this resemblance to real things that gives objects much of their power and appeal. They can not only model
components of real systems, but equally as well fulfill assigned roles as components in software systems.</p>

<p><strong>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) views the world as <em>a network of interacting objects</em>.</strong></p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> A real world scenario viewed as a network of interacting objects:</p>
<p>You are asked to find out the average age of a group of people Adam, Beth, Charlie, and Daisy. You take a piece of paper and pen, go to each person, ask for their age, and note it down. After collecting the age of all four, you enter it into a calculator to find the total. And then, use the same calculator to divide the total by four, to get the average age. This can be viewed as the objects <code v-pre>You</code>, <code v-pre>Pen</code>, <code v-pre>Paper</code>, <code v-pre>Calculator</code>, <code v-pre>Adam</code>, <code v-pre>Beth</code>, <code v-pre>Charlie</code>, and <code v-pre>Daisy</code> interacting to accomplish the end result of calculating the average age of the four persons. These objects can be considered as connected in a certain network of certain structure.</p>
</box>
<p><strong>OOP solutions try to create a similar object network inside the computer’s memory</strong> – a sort of a virtual simulation of the corresponding real world scenario – <strong>so that a similar result can be achieved programmatically.</strong></p>

<p><strong>OOP does not demand that the virtual world object network follow the real world <em>exactly</em>.</strong></p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Our previous example can be tweaked a bit as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use an object called <code v-pre>Main</code> to represent your role in the scenario.</li>
<li>As there is no physical writing involved, you can replace the <code v-pre>Pen</code> and <code v-pre>Paper</code> with an object called <code v-pre>AgeList</code> that is able to keep a list of ages.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Every object has both state (data) and behavior (operations on data).</strong></p>

<p><strong>Every object has an <em>interface</em> and an <em>implementation</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Every real world object has:</p>
<ul>
<li>an interface through which other objects can interact with it</li>
<li>an implementation that supports the interface but may not be accessible to the other object</li></ul>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> The interface and implementation of some real-world objects in our example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculator: the buttons and the display are part of the interface; circuits are part of the implementation.</li>
<li>Adam: In the context of our 'calculate average age' example, the interface of Adam consists of requests that adam will respond to, e.g.  &quot;Give age to the nearest year, as at Jan 1st of this year&quot; &quot;State your name&quot;; the implementation includes the mental calculation Adam uses to calculate the age which is not visible to other objects.</li></ul></box>
<p>Similarly, every object in the virtual world has an interface and an implementation.</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> The interface and implementation of some virtual-world objects in our example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code v-pre>Adam</code>: the interface might have a method <code v-pre>getAge(Date asAt)</code>; the implementation of that method is not visible to other objects.</li></ul></box>
<p><strong>Objects interact by sending messages.</strong> Both real world and virtual world object interactions can be viewed as objects sending message to each other. The message can result in the sender object receiving a response and/or the receiver object’s state being changed. Furthermore, the result can vary based on which object received the message, even if the message is identical <span class="dimmed">(see rows 1 and 2 in the example below)</span>.</p>

<p>Instructions for creating objects <code v-pre>Adam</code>, <code v-pre>Beth</code>, <code v-pre>Charlie</code>, and <code v-pre>Daisy</code> will be very similar because they are all of the same kind: they all represent ‘persons’ with the same interface, the same kind of data (i.e. <code v-pre>name</code>, <code v-pre>dateOfBrith</code>, etc.), and the same kind of behavior (i.e. <code v-pre>getAge(Date)</code>, <code v-pre>getName()</code>, etc.). Therefore, you can have a class called <code v-pre>Person</code> containing instructions on how to create <code v-pre>Person</code> objects and use that class to instantiate objects <code v-pre>Adam</code>, <code v-pre>Beth</code>, <code v-pre>Charlie</code>, and <code v-pre>Daisy</code>.</p>
<p>Similarly, you need classes <code v-pre>AgeList</code>, <code v-pre>Calculator</code>, and <code v-pre>Main</code> classes to instantiate one each of <code v-pre>AgeList</code>, <code v-pre>Calculator</code>, and <code v-pre>Main</code> objects.</p>

<li>When modeling an application that gather analytics about email traffic, the answer may be 'no' <span class="dimmed">(e.g., the application might collect just the email subjects for text analysis)</span>.</li></ul></box>
<p><strong>A common use of composition is when parts of a big class is carved out as smaller classes</strong> for the ease of managing the internal design. In such cases, the classes extracted out still act as <em>parts</em> of the bigger class and the outside world has no business knowing about them.</p>
<p><strong>Cascading deletion alone is not sufficient for composition.</strong> Suppose there is a design in which <code v-pre>Person</code> objects are attached to <code v-pre>Task</code> objects and the former get deleted whenever the latter is deleted. This fact alone does not mean there is a composition relationship between the two classes. For it to be composition, a <code v-pre>Person</code> must be an integral <em>part</em> of a <code v-pre>Task</code> in the context of that association, at the concept level (not simply at implementation level).</p>
<p><strong>Identifying and keeping track of composition relationships in the design has benefits</strong> such as helping to maintain the data integrity of the system. For example, when you know that a certain relationship is a composition, you can take extra care in your implementation to ensure that when the <em>whole</em> object is deleted, all its <em>parts</em> are deleted too.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>The OOP concept <em>Inheritance</em> allows you to define a new class based on an existing class.</strong></p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> For example, you can use inheritance to define an <code v-pre>EvaluationReport</code> class based on an existing <code v-pre>Report</code> class so that the <code v-pre>EvaluationReport</code> class does not have to duplicate data/behaviors that are already implemented in the <code v-pre>Report</code> class. The <code v-pre>EvaluationReport</code> can inherit the <code v-pre>wordCount</code> attribute and the <code v-pre>print()</code> method from the <em>base class</em> <code v-pre>Report</code>.</p></box>
<ul>
<li>Other names for Base class: <em>Parent</em> class, <em>Super</em> class</li>
<li>Other names for Derived class: <em>Child</em> class, <em>Sub</em> class, <em>Extended</em> class</li></ul>
<p><strong>A superclass is said to be <em>more general</em> than the subclass.</strong> Conversely, a subclass is said to be more <em>specialized</em> than the superclass.</p>
<p><strong>Applying inheritance on a group of similar classes can result in the common parts among classes being extracted into more general classes.</strong></p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> <code v-pre>Man</code> and <code v-pre>Woman</code> behaves the same way for certain things. However, the two classes cannot be simply replaced with a more general class <code v-pre>Person</code> because of the need to distinguish between <code v-pre>Man</code> and <code v-pre>Woman</code> for certain other things. A solution is to add the <code v-pre>Person</code> class as a superclass (to contain the code common to men and women) and let <code v-pre>Man</code> and <code v-pre>Woman</code> inherit from <code v-pre>Person</code> class.</p></box>
<p><strong>Inheritance implies the derived class can be considered as a <em>sub-type</em> of the base class (and the base class is a <em>super-type</em> of the derived class), resulting in an <em>is a</em> relationship.</strong></p>
<p><span class="dimmed"><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-info-circle"></span></span> Inheritance does not necessarily mean a sub-type relationship exists. However, the two often go hand-in-hand. For simplicity, at this point let us assume inheritance implies a sub-type relationship.</span></p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> To continue the previous example,</p>
<ul>
<li><code v-pre>Woman</code> <em>is a</em> <code v-pre>Person</code></li>
<li><code v-pre>Man</code> <em>is a</em> <code v-pre>Person</code></li></ul></box>
<p><strong>Inheritance relationships through a chain of classes can result in inheritance <em>hierarchies</em> (aka inheritance <em>trees</em>).</strong></p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Two inheritance hierarchies/trees are given below. <span class="dimmed">Note that the triangle points to the parent class.</span> Observe how the <code v-pre>Parrot</code> <em>is a</em> <code v-pre>Bird</code> as well as it <em>is an</em> <code v-pre>Animal</code>.</p>
<img src="/website/book/oop/inheritance/what/images/inheritanceTreesExamples.png" width="500">
<p></p></box>
<p><strong><em>Multiple Inheritance</em> is when a class inherits <em>directly</em> from multiple classes.</strong> Multiple inheritance among classes is allowed in some languages (e.g., Python, C++) but not in other languages (e.g., Java, C#).</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> The <code v-pre>Honey</code> class inherits from the <code v-pre>Food</code> class <em>and</em> the <code v-pre>Medicine</code> class <span class="dimmed">because honey can be consumed as a food as well as a medicine (in some oriental medicine practices)</span>. Similarly, a <code v-pre>Car</code> is an <code v-pre>Vehicle</code>, an <code v-pre>Asset</code> and a <code v-pre>Liability</code>.</p>

<li>Constraints: e.g.  the system should be backward compatible with data produced by earlier versions of the system; system testers are available only during the last month of the project; the total project cost should not exceed $1.5 million.</li>
<li>Technical requirements: e.g. the system should work on both 32-bit and 64-bit environments.</li>
<li>Performance requirements: e.g. the system should respond within two seconds.</li>
<li>Quality requirements: e.g. the system should be usable by a novice who has never carried out an online purchase.</li>
<li>Process requirements: e.g. the project is expected to adhere to a schedule that delivers a feature set every one month.</li>
<li>Notes about project scope: e.g. the product is not required to handle the printing of reports.</li>
<li>Any other noteworthy points: e.g. the game should not use images deemed offensive to those injured in real mine clearing activities.

<p>You may have to spend an extra effort in digging NFRs out as early as possible because,</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>NFRs are easier to miss</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g., stakeholders tend to think of functional requirements first</span></li>
<li>sometimes <strong>NFRs are critical to the success of the software.</strong> <span class="dimmed">E.g. A web application that is too slow or that has low security is unlikely to succeed even if it has all the right functionality.</span></li></ol></div></div></div></div>

<p>Given their lightweight nature, <strong>user stories are quite handy for recording requirements during early stages of requirements gathering</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="a-recipe-for-brainstorming-user-stories">A recipe for brainstorming user stories<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#a-recipe-for-brainstorming-user-stories" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h4>
<p>Given below is a possible <em>recipe</em> you can take when using user stories for early stages of requirement gathering.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Step 0:</strong></strong> <strong>Clear your mind of preconceived product ideas</strong></p>
<p>Even if you already have some idea of what your product will look/behave like in the end, clear your mind of those ideas. The product is the <em>solution</em>. At this point, we are still at the stage of figuring out the <em>problem</em> (i.e., user requirements). Let's try to get from the problem to the solution in a systematic way, one step at a time.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> <strong>Define the <em>target user</em> as a <em>persona</em>:</strong></p>
<p>Decide your target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, sales person) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer with others?). A clear understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story. You can even narrow it down to a <em>persona</em>. Here is an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jean is a university student studying in a non-IT field. She interacts with a lot of people due to her involvement in university clubs/societies. ...</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> <strong>Define the <em>problem scope</em>:</strong></p>
<p>Decide the exact problem you are going to solve for the target user. It is also useful to specify what related problems it will <em>not</em> solve so that the exact scope is clear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ProductX helps Jean keep track of all her school contacts. It does not cover communicating with contacts.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> <strong>List <em>scenarios</em> to form a <em>narrative</em>:</strong></p>
<p>Think of the various scenarios your target user is likely to go through as she uses your app. Following a chronological sequence as if you are telling a story might be helpful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A. First use:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Jean get to know about ProductX. She downloads it and launches it to check out what it can do.</li>
<li>After playing around with the product for a bit, Jean wants to start using it for real.</li>
<li>...</li></ol>
<p><strong>B. Second use:</strong> (Jean is still a beginner)</p>
<ol>
<li>Jean launches ProductX. She wants to find ...</li>
<li>...</li></ol>
<p><strong>C. 10th use:</strong> (Jean is a little bit familiar with the app)</p>
<ol>
<li>...</li></ol>
<p><strong>D. 100th use:</strong> (Jean is an expert user)</p>
<ol>
<li>Jean launches the app and does ... and ... followed by ... as per her usual habit.</li>
<li>Jean feels some of the data in the app are no longer needed. She wants to get rid of them to reduce clutter.</li>
<li></li></ol></blockquote>
<p>More examples that might apply to some products:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Jean uses the app at the start of the day to ...</li>
<li>Jean uses the app before going to sleep to ...</li>
<li>Jean doesn't use app for a while because she was on a three-month training programme. She is now back at work and wants to resume her daily use of the app.</li>
<li>Jean moves to another company. Some of her clients come with her but some don't.</li>
<li>Jean starts freelancing in her spare time. She wants to keep her free-lancing clients separate from her other clients.</li></ul></blockquote>
<p><strong><strong>Step 4:</strong></strong> <strong>List the user stories to support the scenarios:</strong></p>
<p>Based on the scenarios, decide user stories you need to support each. For example, based on the scenario 'A. First use', you might have user stories such as these:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>As a potential user exploring the app, I can see the app populated with sample data, so that I can easily see how the app will look like when it is in use.</li>
<li>As a user ready to start using the app, I can purge all current data, so that I can get rid of sample/experimental data I used for exploring the app.</li></ul></blockquote>
<p>To give another example, based on the scenario 'D. 100th use', you might have user stories such as these:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>As an expert user, I can create shortcuts for tasks, so that I can save time on frequently performed tasks.</li>
<li>As a long-time user, I can archive/hide unused data, so that I am not distracted by irrelevant data.</li></ul></blockquote>
<p><mark>Do not 'evaluate' the value of user stories while brainstorming</mark>. <span class="dimmed">Reason: an important aspect of brainstorming is not judging the ideas generated.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong>Other tips:</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong>
Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for the target users.</li>
<li><strong>Don't go into too much details:</strong><br>
For example, consider this user story: <code v-pre>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br>
When discussing this user story, don't worry about what tasks should be considered <em>needs my attention most at the present time</em>. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
<li><strong>Don't be biased by preconceived product ideas:</strong><br>
When you are at the stage of identifying user needs, clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like. That is, don't try to reverse-engineer a preconceived product idea into user stories.</li>
<li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br>
When gathering requirements, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation details can be discussed later. If a user story turns out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always omit it from the implementation plan.</li></ul></box></div>

<p><a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/userstories.html">This page</a> in their website explains the difference between user stories and traditional requirements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the biggest misunderstandings with user stories is how they differ from traditional requirements specifications. The biggest difference is in the level of detail. User stories should only provide enough detail to make a reasonably low risk estimate of how long the story will take to implement. When the time comes to implement the story developers will go to the customer and receive a detailed description of the requirements face to face.</p></blockquote></b-modal></div></div></div></div>

<question>
<p>Given below are some requirements of TEAMMATES (an online peer evaluation system for education). Which one of these are non-functional requirements?</p>
<ul class="contains-task-list">
<li class="task-list-item enabled"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" type="checkbox"> a. The response to any use action should become visible within 5 seconds.</li>
<li class="task-list-item enabled"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" type="checkbox"> b. The application admin should be able to view a log of user activities.</li>
<li class="task-list-item enabled"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" type="checkbox"> c. The source code should be open source.</li>
<li class="task-list-item enabled"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" type="checkbox"> d. A course should be able to have up to 2000 students.</li>
<li class="task-list-item enabled"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" type="checkbox"> e. As a student user, I can view details of my team members so that I can know who they are.</li>
<li class="task-list-item enabled"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" type="checkbox"> f. The user interface should be intuitive enough for users who are not IT-savvy.</li>
<li class="task-list-item enabled"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" type="checkbox"> g. The product is offered as a free online service.</li></ul>
<div slot="answer" class="algolia-no-index">
<p>(a)(c)(d)(f)(g)</p>
<p>Explanation: (b) are (e) are functions available for a specific user types. Therefore, they are functional requirements. (a), (c), (d), (f) and (g) are either constraints on functionality or constraints on how the project is done, both of which are considered non-functional requirements.</p></div></question></panel></div></panel></div></div></div></div></div></b-modal></div></div></div></div>

<p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is a technique for dealing with complexity. It works by establishing a level of complexity we are interested in, and suppressing the more complex details below that level.</p></div></box>
<p><strong>The guiding principle of abstraction is that only details that are relevant to the current perspective or the task at hand needs to be considered.</strong> As most programs are written to solve complex problems involving large amounts of intricate details, it is impossible to deal with all these details at the same time.

<p><strong><em>Coupling</em> is a measure of the degree of <em>dependence</em></strong> between components, classes, methods, etc. Low coupling indicates that a component is less dependent on other components. <strong>High coupling (aka <em>tight</em> coupling or <em>strong</em> coupling) is discouraged</strong> due to the following disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintenance is harder</strong> because a change in one module could cause changes in other modules coupled to it (i.e. a ripple effect).</li>
<li><strong>Integration is harder</strong> because multiple components coupled with each other have to be integrated at the same time.</li>

<p><strong><em>Model-driven development (MDD)</em>, also called <em>Model-driven engineering</em>, is an approach to software development that strives to exploit models as blueprints.</strong> MDD uses models as primary engineering artifacts when developing software. That is, the system is first created in the form of models. After that, the models are converted to code using code-generation techniques (usually, automated or semi-automated, but can even involve manual translation from model to code). MDD requires the use of a very expressive modeling notation (graphical or otherwise), often specific to a given problem domain. It also requires sophisticated tools to generate code from models and maintain the link between models and the code. One advantage of MDD is that the same model can be used to create software for different platforms and different languages. MDD has a lot of promise, but it is still an emerging technology</p>

<p><a href="http://www.uml.org/#UML2.0"><strong>Unified Modeling Language (UML)</strong></a> is a graphical notation to describe various aspects of a software system. UML is the brainchild of three software modeling specialists James Rumbaugh, Grady Booch and Ivar Jacobson (also known as the Three Amigos). Each of them has developed their own notation for modeling software systems before joining force to create a unified modeling language (hence, the term ‘Unified’ in UML). UML is currently the <em>de facto</em> modeling notation used in the software industry.</p></div></b-modal>

<p>An OO solution is basically a network of objects interacting with each other. Therefore, <strong>it is useful to be able to model how the relevant objects are 'networked' together</strong> inside a software <span class="dimmed">i.e. how the objects are connected together</span>.</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Given below is an illustration of some objects and how they are connected together. <span class="dimmed">Note: the diagram uses an ad-hoc notation.</span></p>
<p><img src="/website/book/modeling/modelingStructures/ooStructures/images/objectsAdHoc.png" width="500"></p><p></p></box>
<p>Note that these <strong>object structures within the same software can change over time</strong>.</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Given below is how the object structure in the previous example could have looked like at a different time.</p>
<p><img src="/website/book/modeling/modelingStructures/ooStructures/images/objectsAdHoc2.png" width="500"></p><p></p></box>
<p>However, object structures do not change at random; they change based on a set of rules, as was decided by the designer of that software. Those <strong>rules that object structures need to follow can be illustrated as a <em>class structure</em></strong> <span class="dimmed">i.e. a structure that exists among the relevant classes</span>.</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Here is a class structure (drawn using an ad-hoc notation) that matches the object structures given in the previous two examples. For example, note how this class structure does not allow any connection between <code v-pre>Genre</code> objects and <code v-pre>Author</code> objects, a rule followed by the two object structures above.</p>

<p>UML <em>Object Diagrams</em> are used to model object structures and UML <em>Class Diagrams</em> are used to model class structures of an OO solution.</p>

<p><strong>Professional software engineers often write code using <em>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</em>. IDEs support most development-related work within the same tool</strong> (hence, the term <em>integrated</em>).</p>
<p>An IDE generally consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A source code editor that includes features such as syntax coloring, auto-completion, easy code navigation, error highlighting, and code-snippet generation.</li>
<li>A compiler and/or an interpreter (together with other build automation support) that facilitates the compilation/linking/running/deployment of a program.</li>
<li>A debugger that allows the developer to execute the program one step at a time to observe the run-time behavior in order to locate bugs.</li>
<li>Other tools that aid various aspects of coding e.g. support for automated testing, drag-and-drop construction of UI components, version management support, simulation of the target runtime platform, and modeling support.</li></ul>
<p>Examples of popular IDEs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java: Eclipse, Intellij IDEA, NetBeans</li>
<li>C#, C++: Visual Studio</li>
<li>Swift: XCode</li>
<li>Python: PyCharm</li></ul>
<p>Some Web-based IDEs have appeared in recent times too e.g., Amazon's <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">Cloud9 IDE</a>.</p>
<p>Some experienced developers, in particular those with a UNIX background, prefer lightweight yet powerful text editors with scripting capabilities (e.g. <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>) over heavier IDEs.</p></div></div></div></div>

<p><strong><em>Debugging</em> is the process of discovering defects in the program.</strong> Here are some approaches to debugging:</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="red"><span><strong><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-thumbs-down"></span></span> Bad</strong></span></font> -- <strong>By inserting temporary print statements</strong>: This is an ad-hoc approach in which print statements are inserted in the program to print information relevant to debugging, such as variable values. e.g. <code v-pre>Exiting process() method, x is 5.347</code>. This approach is not recommended due to these reasons.
<ul>
<li>Incurs extra effort when inserting and removing the print statements.</li>
<li>These extraneous program modifications increases the risk of introducing errors into the program.</li>
<li>These print statements, if not removed promptly after the debugging, may even appear unexpectedly in the production version.</li></ul></li>
<li><font color="red"><span><strong><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-thumbs-down"></span></span> Bad</strong></span></font> -- <strong>By manually tracing through the code</strong>: Otherwise known as ‘eye-balling’, this approach doesn't have the cons of the previous approach, but it too is not recommended (other than as a 'quick try') due to these reasons:
<ul>
<li>It is difficult, time consuming, and error-prone technique.</li>
<li>If you didn't spot the error while writing code, you might not spot the error when reading code too.</li></ul></li>
<li><font color="green"><span><strong><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-thumbs-up"></span></span> Good</strong></span></font> -- <strong>Using a debugger</strong>:  A debugger tool allows you to pause the execution, then step through one statement at a time while examining the internal state if necessary. Most IDEs come with an inbuilt debugger. <strong>This is the recommended approach for debugging</strong>.</li></ul></div></div></div></div>

<p><strong>Among various dimensions of code quality, such as run-time efficiency, security, and robustness, one of the most important is understandability.</strong> This is because in any non-trivial software project, code needs to be read, understood, and modified by other developers later on. Even if you do not intend to pass the code to someone else, code quality is still important because you will become a 'stranger' to your own code someday.</p>

<p><strong>One essential way to improve code quality is to follow a consistent style. That is why software engineers follow a strict coding standard (aka <em>style guide</em>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>The aim of a coding standard is to make the entire code base look like it was written by one person</strong>. A coding standard is usually specific to a programming language and specifies guidelines such as the location of opening and closing braces, indentation styles and naming styles (e.g. whether to use <em>Hungarian style</em>, <em>Pascal casing</em>, <em>Camel casing</em>, etc.). It is important that the whole team/company use the same coding standard and that standard is not generally inconsistent with typical industry practices. <span class="dimmed">If a company's coding standards is very different from what is used typically in the industry, new recruits will take longer to get used to the company's coding style.</span></p>

It is OK to first concentrate on making the code work, rather than worry over the quality of the code, as long as you improve the quality later.

<p><strong>Developer-to-developer documentation can be in one of two forms:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Documentation for <em>developer-as-user</em></strong>: Software components are written by developers and reused by other developers, which means there is a need to document how such components are to be used. Such documentation can take several forms:
<ul>
<li>API documentation: APIs expose functionality in small-sized, independent and easy-to-use chunks, each of which can be documented systematically.</li>
<li>Tutorial-style instructional documentation: In addition to explaining functions/methods independently, some higher-level explanations of how to use an API can be useful.</li></ul></li></ol>

<li><strong>Documentation for <em>developer-as-maintainer</em></strong>: There is a need to document how a system or a component is designed, implemented and tested so that other developers can maintain and evolve the code. Writing documentation of this type is harder because of the need to explain complex internal details. However, given that readers of this type of documentation usually have access to the source code itself, only <em>some</em> information need to be included in the documentation, as code (and code comments) can also serve as a complementary source of information.</li></ol>

<p>Another view proposed by Daniele Procida in <a href="https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/">this article</a>, is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>There is a secret that needs to be understood in order to write good software documentation: there isn’t one thing called documentation, there are four.
They are: tutorials, how-to guides, explanation and technical reference.</strong> They represent four different purposes or functions, and require four different approaches to their creation. Understanding the implications of this will help improve most software documentation - often immensely.

<p><strong>Software documentation (applies to both user-facing and developer-facing) is best kept in a text format</strong>, for the ease of version tracking. <strong>A writer friendly source format is also desirable</strong> as non-programmers (e.g., technical writers) may need to author/edit such documents. As a result, formats such as Markdown, Asciidoc, and PlantUML are often used for software documentation.</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Here are some tips on writing effective documentation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use plenty of diagrams</strong>: It is not enough to explain something in words; complement it with visual illustrations (e.g. a UML diagram).</li>
<li><strong>Use plenty of examples</strong>: When explaining algorithms, show a running example to illustrate each step of the algorithm, in parallel to worded explanations.</li>
<li><strong>Use simple and direct explanations</strong>: Convoluted explanations and fancy words will annoy readers. Avoid long sentences.</li>
<li><strong>Get rid of statements that do not add value</strong>: For example, 'We made sure our system works perfectly' (who didn't?), 'Component X has its own responsibilities' (of course it has!).</li>
<li><strong>It is not a good idea to have separate sections for each type of artifact</strong>, such as 'use cases', 'sequence diagrams', 'activity diagrams', etc. Such a structure, coupled with the indiscriminate inclusion of diagrams without justifying their need, indicates a failure to understand the purpose of documentation. Include diagrams when they are needed to explain something. If you want to provide additional diagrams for completeness' sake, include them in the appendix as a reference.</li></ul></div></div></div></div>

<p>Anything that is already clear in the code need not be described in words. Instead, <strong>focus on providing higher level information that is not readily visible in the code or comments</strong>.</p>
<p>Refrain from duplicating chunks or text. When describing several similar algorithms/designs/APIs, etc., do not simply duplicate large chunks of text.

<p><strong>Most languages allow code that encountered an &quot;exceptional&quot; situation to encapsulate details of the situation in an <em>Exception</em> object and <em>throw</em>/<em>raise</em> that object so that another piece of code can <em>catch</em> it and deal with it.</strong> This is especially useful when the code that encountered the unusual situation does not know how to deal with it.</p>
<p>The extract below from the <small><span style="opacity: 0.5"><span class="badge badge-secondary">-- Java Tutorial</span></span></small> (with slight adaptations) explains how exceptions are typically handled.</p>
<div class="indented">
<p><strong>When an error occurs at some point in the execution, the code being executed creates an <em>exception object</em> and hands it off to the runtime system.</strong> The exception object contains information about the error, including its type and the state of the program when the error occurred. Creating an exception object and handing it to the runtime system is called <em>throwing</em> an exception.</p>
<p><strong>After a method throws an exception, the runtime system attempts to find something to handle it in the <span data-mb-component-type="tooltip" v-b-tooltip.hover.top.html="tooltipInnerContentGetter" class="trigger"><span data-mb-html-for="_content">the ordered list of methods that had been called to get to the method where the error occurred</span><em>call stack</em></span>.</strong> The runtime system searches the call stack for a method that contains a block of code that can handle the exception. This block of code is called an <em>exception handler</em>. The search begins with the method in which the error occurred and proceeds through the call stack in the reverse order in which the methods were called. When an appropriate handler is found, the runtime system passes the exception to the handler. An exception handler is considered appropriate if the type of the exception object thrown matches the type that can be handled by the handler.</p>
<p><strong>The exception handler chosen is said to <em>catch</em> the exception.</strong> If the runtime system exhaustively searches all the methods on the call stack without finding an appropriate exception handler, the program terminates.</p></div>
<p>Advantages of exception handling in this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to propagate error information through the call stack.</li>
<li>The separation of code that deals with 'unusual' situations from the code that does the 'usual' work.</li></ul></div></div></div>

<p>In a non-trivial project, building a product from source code can be a complex multi-step process. <span class="dimmed">For example, it can include steps such as to pull code from the revision control system, compile, link, run automated tests, automatically update release documents (e.g. build number), package into a distributable, push to repo, deploy to a server, delete temporary files created during building/testing, email developers of the new build, and so on. Furthermore, this build process can be done ‘on demand’, it can be scheduled (e.g. every day at midnight) or it can be triggered by various events (e.g. triggered by a code push to the revision control system).</span></p>
<p>Some of these build steps such as to compile, link and package are already automated in most modern IDEs. <span class="dimmed">For example, several steps happen automatically when the ‘build’ button of the IDE is clicked. Some IDEs even allow customization to this build process to some extent.</span></p>
<p>However, most big projects use specialized build tools to automate complex build processes.</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Some popular build tools relevant to Java developers: <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a>, <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>, <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a></p>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> <span class="dimmed">Some other build tools : Grunt (JavaScript), Rake (Ruby)</span></p></box>
<p><strong>Some build tools also serve as <em>dependency management tools</em></strong>. Modern software projects often depend on third party libraries that evolve constantly. That means developers need to download the correct version of the required libraries and update them regularly. Therefore, dependency management is an important part of build automation. Dependency Management tools can automate that aspect of a project.</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Maven and Gradle, in addition to managing the build process, can play the role of dependency management tools too.</p></box></div></div></div></div>

<p>Reuse is a major theme in software engineering practices. <strong>By reusing tried-and-tested components, the robustness of a new software system can be enhanced while reducing the manpower and time requirement.</strong> Reusable components come in many forms; it can be reusing a piece of code, a subsystem, or a whole software.</p></div></div></div>

<p>While you may be tempted to use many libraries/frameworks/platform that seem to crop up on a regular basis and promise to bring great benefits, note that <strong>there are costs associated with reuse</strong>. Here are some:</p>
<ul>
<li>The reused code <strong>may be an overkill</strong> (think <em>using a sledgehammer to crack a nut</em>) increasing the size of, or/and degrading the performance of, your software.</li>
<li>The reused software <strong>may not be mature/stable enough</strong> to be used in an important product. That means the software can change drastically and rapidly, possibly in ways that break your software.</li>
<li>Non-mature software has the <strong>risk of dying off</strong> as fast as they emerged, leaving you with a dependency that is no longer maintained.</li>
<li>The license of the reused software (or its dependencies) <strong>restrict how you can use/develop your software</strong>.</li>
<li>The reused software <strong>might have bugs, missing features, or security vulnerabilities</strong> that are important to your product but not so important to the maintainers of that software, which means those flaws will not get fixed as fast as you need them to.</li>
<li><strong>Malicious code can sneak into your product</strong> via compromised dependencies.</li></ul></div></div></div></div>

<p><strong>Static analysis</strong>: Static analysis is the analysis of code without actually executing the code.</p></div></box>
<p><strong>Static analysis of code can find useful information such unused variables</strong>, unhandled exceptions, style errors, and statistics. Most modern IDEs come with some inbuilt static analysis capabilities. For example, an IDE can highlight unused variables as you type the code into the editor.</p>
<p>The term <em>static</em> in static analysis refers to the fact that the code is analyzed without executing the code. <strong>In contrast, <em>dynamic analysis</em> requires the code to be executed to gather additional information about the code</strong> e.g., performance characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>Higher-end static analyzer tools can perform more complex analysis such as locating potential bugs</strong>, memory leaks, inefficient code structures etc.</p>

<p><strong>Testing</strong>: Operating a system or component under specified conditions, observing or recording the results, and making an evaluation of some aspect of the system or component.  –- source: IEEE</p></div></box>

<p></p>
<p><strong>When testing, you execute a set of <em>test cases</em>.</strong> A test case specifies how to perform a test. At a minimum, it specifies the input to the <em>software under test (SUT)</em> and the expected behavior.</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Example: A minimal test case for testing a browser:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input</strong> – Start the browser using a blank page (vertical scrollbar disabled). Then, load <code v-pre>longfile.html</code> located in the <code v-pre>test data</code> folder.</li>
<li><strong>Expected behavior</strong> – The scrollbar should be automatically enabled upon loading <code v-pre>longfile.html</code>.</li></ul></box>
<p><strong>Test cases can be determined based on the specification, reviewing similar existing systems, or comparing to the past behavior of the SUT.</strong></p>

A more elaborate test case can have other details such as those given below.  
<ul>
<li>A unique identifier : <span class="dimmed">e.g. TC0034-a</span></li>
<li>A descriptive name: <span class="dimmed">e.g. vertical scrollbar activation for long web pages</span></li>
<li>Objectives: <span class="dimmed">e.g. to check whether the vertical scrollbar is correctly activated when a long web page is loaded to the browser</span></li>
<li>Classification information: <span class="dimmed">e.g. priority - medium, category - UI features</span></li>
<li>Cleanup, if any: <span class="dimmed">e.g. empty the browser cache.</span></li></ul>
<p></p></panel><p></p><p></p>
<p>For each test case you should do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Feed the input to the SUT</li>
<li>Observe the actual output</li>
<li>Compare actual output with the expected output</li></ol>
<p><strong>A test case <em>failure</em> is a mismatch between the expected behavior and the actual behavior. A failure indicates a potential <em>defect</em> (or a bug)</strong>, unless the error is in the test case itself.</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Example: In the browser example above, a test case failure is implied if the scrollbar remains disabled after loading <code v-pre>longfile.html</code>. The defect/bug causing that failure could be an uninitialized variable.</p></box>

<p>Here is another definition of testing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Software testing consists of the <em>dynamic</em> verification that a program provides <em>expected</em> behaviors on a <em>finite</em> set of test cases, suitably <em>selected</em> from the usually infinite execution domain. <sub>-– source: <a href="https://www.computer.org/web/swebok/v3">Software Engineering Book of Knowledge V3</a></sub></p></blockquote>
<p>Some things to note (indicated by keywords in the above definition):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Dynamic</em>: Testing involves executing the software. It is not by examining the code statically.</li>
<li><em>Finite</em>: In most non-trivial cases there are potentially infinite test scenarios but resource constraints dictate that we can test only a finite number of scenarios.</li>
<li><em>Selected</em>: In most cases it is not possible to test all scenarios. That means we need to select what scenarios to test.</li>
<li><em>Expected</em>: Testing requires some knowledge of how the software is expected to behave.</li></ul>

<p><strong><em>System testing</em>: take the <em>whole system</em> and test it <em>against the system specification</em>.</strong></p></div></box>
<p>System testing is typically done by a testing team (also called a QA team).</p>
<p><strong>System test cases are based on the specified external behavior of the system.</strong> Sometimes, system tests go beyond the bounds defined in the specification. This is useful when testing that the system fails 'gracefully' having pushed beyond its limits.</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Suppose the SUT is a browser supposedly capable of handling web pages containing up to 5000 characters. Given below is a test case to test if the SUT fails gracefully if pushed beyond its limits.</p>

<p><strong>Delaying testing until the full product is complete has a number of disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Locating the cause of such a test case failure is difficult due to a large search space;</strong> in a large system, the search space could be millions of lines of code, written by hundreds of developers! The failure may also be due to multiple inter-related bugs.</li>
<li><strong>Fixing a bug found during such testing could result in major rework</strong>, especially if the bug originated during the design or during requirements specification <span class="dimmed">i.e. a faulty design or faulty requirements</span>.</li>
<li><strong>One bug might 'hide' other bugs</strong>, which could emerge only after the first bug is fixed.</li>
<li><strong>The delivery may have to be delayed</strong> if too many bugs were found during testing.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Here are two alternative approaches to testing a software: <em>Scripted</em> testing and <em>Exploratory</em> testing</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Scripted testing:</strong>  First write a set of test cases based on the expected behavior of the SUT, and then perform testing based on that set of test cases.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exploratory testing:</strong> Devise test cases on-the-fly, creating new test cases based on the results of the past test cases.</p></li></ol>
<p>Exploratory testing is ‘the simultaneous learning, test design, and test execution’ <span trigger="click" for="modal:exploratoryWhat-bach-et-explained" v-b-popover.click.top.html="popoverGenerator" v-b-tooltip.click.top.html="tooltipContentGetter" v-on:click="$refs['modal:exploratoryWhat-bach-et-explained'].show()" class="trigger-click">[source: bach-et-explained]</span> whereby the nature of the follow-up test case is decided based on the behavior of the previous test cases. In other words, running the system and trying out various operations. It is called <em>exploratory testing</em> because testing is driven by observations during testing. Exploratory testing usually starts with areas identified as error-prone, based on the tester’s past experience with similar systems. One tends to conduct more tests for those operations where more faults are found.</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Here is an example thought process behind a segment of an exploratory testing session:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hmm... looks like feature x is broken. This usually means feature n and k could be broken too; you need to look at them soon.
But before that, you should give a good test run to feature y because users can still use the product if feature y works, even if x doesn’t work. Now, if feature y doesn’t work 100%, you have a major problem and this has to be made known to the development team sooner rather than later...”</p></blockquote></box>

<p>Which approach is better – <strong>scripted or exploratory? A mix is better.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The success of exploratory testing depends on the tester’s prior experience and intuition.</strong> Exploratory testing should be done by experienced testers, using a clear strategy/plan/framework. Ad-hoc exploratory testing by unskilled or inexperienced testers without a clear strategy is not recommended for real-world non-trivial systems. While <strong>exploratory testing may allow us to detect some problems in a relatively short time, it is not prudent to use exploratory testing as the sole means of testing a critical system</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Scripted testing is more systematic, and hence, likely to discover more bugs given sufficient time</strong>, while exploratory testing would aid in quick error discovery, especially if the tester has a lot of experience in testing similar systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In some contexts, you will achieve your testing mission better through a more scripted approach; in other contexts, your mission will benefit more from the ability to create and improve tests as you execute them. I find that most situations benefit from a mix of scripted and exploratory approaches.

<p><strong>When you modify a system, the modification may result in some unintended and undesirable effects on the system. Such an effect is called a <em>regression</em>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A simple way to semi-automate testing of a CLI(Command Line Interface) app is by using input/output re-direction.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First, you feed the app with a sequence of test inputs that is stored in a file while redirecting the output to another file.</li>
<li>Next, you compare the actual output file with another file containing the expected output.</li></ul>
<p>Lets assume you are testing a CLI app called <code v-pre>AddressBook</code>. Here are the detailed steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Store the test input in the text file <code v-pre>input.txt</code>.</p>
<panel type="seamless" class="algolia-no-index"><template slot="_header"><p><span class="dimmed"><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Example <code v-pre>input.txt</code></span></p></template>
<pre><code class="hljs" v-pre><span>add Valid Name p/12345 valid@email.butNoPrefix<br></span><span>add Valid Name 12345 e/valid@email.butPhonePrefixMissing<br></span></code></pre></panel></li>
<li>
<p>Store the output you expect from the SUT in another text file <code v-pre>expected.txt</code>.</p>
<panel type="seamless" class="algolia-no-index"><template slot="_header"><p><span class="dimmed"><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Example <code v-pre>expected.txt</code></span></p></template>
<pre><code class="hljs" v-pre><span>Command: || [add Valid Name p/12345 valid@email.butNoPrefix]<br></span><span>Invalid command format: add <br></span><span><br></span><span>Command: || [add Valid Name 12345 e/valid@email.butPhonePrefixMissing]<br></span><span>Invalid command format: add <br></span></code></pre></panel></li>
<li>
<p>Run the program as given below, which will redirect the text in <code v-pre>input.txt</code> as the input to <code v-pre>AddressBook</code> and similarly, will redirect the output of AddressBook to a text file <code v-pre>output.txt</code>. <span class="dimmed">Note that this does not require any code changes to <code v-pre>AddressBook</code>.</span></p>
<pre><code class="no-line-numbers hljs sh" v-pre><span>java AddressBook &lt; input.txt &gt; output.txt<br></span></code></pre><ul>
<li>
<p><span class="badge badge-pill badge-warning"><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-lightbulb"></span></span> The way to run a CLI program differs based on the language.<br>
e.g., In Python, assuming the code is in <code v-pre>AddressBook.py</code> file, use the command<br>
<code v-pre>python AddressBook.py &lt; input.txt &gt; output.txt</code></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge badge-pill badge-warning"><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-lightbulb"></span></span> If you are using Windows, use a normal command window to run the app, not a Power Shell window.</p></li></ul>
<panel minimized class="algolia-no-index"><template slot="_header"></template>
<span slot="header" class="card-title"><span>More on the <code v-pre>&gt;</code> operator and the <code v-pre>&lt;</code> operator <span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary"><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-plus"></span> extra</span></span></span></span>
<p>A CLI program takes input from the keyboard and outputs to the console. That is because those two are default input and output streams, respectively. But you can change that behavior using <code v-pre>&lt;</code> and <code v-pre>&gt;</code> operators. For example, if you run <code v-pre>AddressBook</code> in a command window, the output will be shown in the console, but if you run it like this,</p>
<pre><code class="no-line-numbers hljs sh" v-pre><span>java AddressBook &gt; output.txt <br></span></code></pre><p>the Operating System then creates a file <code v-pre>output.txt</code> and stores the output in that file instead of displaying it in the console. No file I/O coding is required. Similarly, adding <code v-pre>&lt; input.txt</code> (or any other filename) makes the OS redirect the contents of the file as input to the program, as if the user typed the content of the file one line at a time.</p>

<p></p></panel><p></p><p></p></li>
<li>
<p>Next, you compare <code v-pre>output.txt</code> with the <code v-pre>expected.txt</code>. This can be done using a utility such as Windows <code v-pre>FC</code> (i.e. File Compare) command, Unix <code v-pre>diff</code> command, or a GUI tool such as <em>WinMerge</em>.</p>
<pre><code class="no-line-numbers hljs" v-pre><span>FC output.txt expected.txt<br></span></code></pre></li></ol>
<p>Note that the above technique is only suitable when testing CLI apps, and only if the exact output can be predetermined. <span class="dimmed">If the output varies from one run to the other (e.g. it contains a time stamp), this technique will not work. In those cases you need more sophisticated ways of automating tests.</span></p>

<p><strong><em>Revision control</em> is the process of managing multiple versions of a piece of information.</strong> In its simplest form, this is something that many people do by hand: every time you modify a file, save it under a new name that contains a number, each one higher than the number of the preceding version.</p>
<p>Manually managing multiple versions of even a single file is an error-prone task, though, so software tools to help automate this process have long been available. The earliest automated revision control tools were intended to help a single user to manage revisions of a single file. Over the past few decades, the scope of revision control tools has expanded greatly; they now manage multiple files, and help multiple people to work together. The best modern revision control tools have no problem coping with thousands of people working together on projects that consist of hundreds of thousands of files.</p>
<p><strong>Revision control software will track the history and evolution of your project</strong>, so you don't have to. For every change, you'll have a log of who made it; why they made it; when they made it; and what the change was.</p>
<p><strong>Revision control software makes it easier for you to collaborate</strong> when you're working with other people. For example, when people more or less simultaneously make potentially incompatible changes, the software will help you to identify and resolve those conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>It can help you to recover from mistakes</strong>. If you make a change that later turns out to be an error, you can revert to an earlier version of one or more files. In fact, a really good revision control tool will even help you to efficiently figure out exactly when a problem was introduced.</p>
<p><strong>It will help you to work simultaneously on, and manage the drift between, multiple versions of your project.</strong> Most of these reasons are equally valid, at least in theory, whether you're working on a project by yourself, or with a hundred other people.</p>

They are especially useful for sharing the revision history of a codebase among team members of a multi-person project. <span class="dimmed">They can also serve as a remote backup of your code base.</span></p>
<p><strong>It is possible to set up your own remote repo on a server</strong>, but the easier option is to use a remote repo hosting service such as GitHub or BitBucket.</p>
<div id="section-cloning">
<p><strong>You can <mark><em>clone</em></mark> a repo</strong> to create a copy of that repo on another location in your computer. The copy will have even the revision history of the original repo i.e., identical to the original repo. For example, you can clone a remote repo onto your computer to create a local copy of the remote repo.<br></p></div>
<p><strong>When you clone from a repo, the original repo is commonly referred to as the <mark><em>upstream</em></mark> repo.</strong> A repo can have multiple upstream repos. For example, let's say a repo <code v-pre>repo1</code> was cloned as <code v-pre>repo2</code> which was then cloned as <code v-pre>repo3</code> In this case <code v-pre>repo1</code> and <code v-pre>repo2</code> are upstream repos of <code v-pre>repo3</code>.</p>
<div id="section-pulling">
<p><strong>You can <mark><em>pull</em></mark> from a repo to another, to receive new commits in the second repo</strong>, if the repos have a shared history. Let's say some new commits were added to the <span data-mb-component-type="tooltip" v-b-tooltip.hover.top.html="tooltipInnerContentGetter" class="trigger"><span data-mb-html-for="_content"><em>upstream</em> repo is a term used to refer to the repo you cloned from</span>upstream repo</span> after you cloned it and you would like to copy over those new commits to your own clone i.e., <mark>sync</mark> your clone with the upstream repo. In that case you pull from the upstream repo to  your clone.</p></div>
<div id="section-pushing">
<p><strong>You can <mark><em>push</em></mark> new commits in one repo to another repo</strong> which will copy the new commits onto the destination repo. Note that pushing to a repo requires you to have write-access to it. Furthermore, you can push between repos only if those repos have a shared history among them (i.e, one was created by copying the other at some point in the past).</p></div>
<p>Cloning, pushing, and pulling can be done between two local repos too, although it is more common for them to involve a remote repo.</p>
<div id="section-working-with-multiple-repos">
<p><strong>A repo can work with any number of other repositories as long as they have a shared history</strong> e.g., <code v-pre>repo1</code> can pull from (or push to) <code v-pre>repo2</code> and <code v-pre>repo3</code> if they have a shared history between them.</p></div>
<div id="section-forking">
<p><strong>A <mark><em>fork</em></mark> is a remote copy of a remote repo</strong>. As you know, cloning creates a local copy of a repo. In contrast, Forking creates a remote copy of a Git repo hosted on GitHub. This is particularly useful if you want to play around with a GitHub repo but you don't have write permissions to it; you can simply fork the repo and do whatever you want with the fork as you are the owner of the fork.</p></div>
<div id="section-pull-request">
<p><strong>A <mark><em>pull request</em></mark> (PR for short) is mechanism for contributing code to a remote repo.</strong> i.e., &quot;I'm <em>requesting</em> you to <em>pull</em> my proposed changes to your repo&quot;. For this to work, the two repos must have a shared history. The most common case is sending PRs from a fork to its <span data-mb-component-type="tooltip" v-b-tooltip.hover.top.html="tooltipInnerContentGetter" class="trigger"><span data-mb-html-for="_content"><em>upstream</em> repo is a repo you forked from</span>upstream</span> repo.</p></div>

<p><strong><mark><em>Branching</em></mark> is the process of evolving multiple versions of the software in parallel.</strong> For example, one team member can create a new branch and add an experimental feature to it while the rest of the team keeps working on another branch.

<p><strong>A <em>Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)</em> depicts information about tasks and their details in terms of subtasks.</strong> When managing projects it is useful to divide the total work into smaller, well-defined units.

<div>
<p><strong><em>Coupling</em> is a measure of the degree of <em>dependence</em></strong> between components, classes, methods, etc. Low coupling indicates that a component is less dependent on other components. <strong>High coupling (aka <em>tight</em> coupling or <em>strong</em> coupling) is discouraged</strong> due to the following disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintenance is harder</strong> because a change in one module could cause changes in other modules coupled to it (i.e. a ripple effect).</li>
<li><strong>Integration is harder</strong> because multiple components coupled with each other have to be integrated at the same time.</li>
<li><strong>Testing and reuse of the module is harder</strong> due to its dependence on other modules.</li></ul>

<p><strong><em>Cohesion</em> is a measure of how strongly-related and focused the various responsibilities of a component are.</strong> A highly-cohesive component keeps related functionalities together while keeping out all other unrelated things.</p>
<p><strong>Higher cohesion is better.</strong> Disadvantages of low cohesion (aka <em>weak</em> cohesion):</p>
<ul>
<li>Lowers the understandability of modules as it is difficult to express module functionalities at a higher level.</li>
<li>Lowers maintainability because a module can be modified due to unrelated causes <span class="dimmed">(reason: the module contains code unrelated to each other)</span> or many many modules may need to be modified to achieve a small change in behavior <span class="dimmed">(reason: because the code related to that change is not localized to a single module)</span>.</li>
<li>Lowers reusability of modules because they do not represent logical units of functionality.</li></ul></div>

<p><strong>1. The first step is to install</strong> <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a> which is Git + a GUI for Git. If you prefer to use Git via the command line (i.e., without a GUI), you can <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">install Git</a> instead.</p>
<p><strong>2. Next, initialize a repository.</strong> Let us assume you want to version control content in a specific directory. In that case you need to initialize a Git repository in that directory. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>Create a directory for the repo (e.g., a directory named <code v-pre>things</code>).</p>
<tabs>

<p><strong>After initializing a repository, Git can help you with revision controlling files inside the <em>working directory</em>. However, it is not automatic.</strong> It is up to you to tell Git which of your changes (aka <em>revisions</em>) should be <em>committed</em> to its memory for later use. Saving changes into Git's memory in that way is often called <em>committing</em> and a change saved to the revision history is called a <em>commit</em>.</p>
<box type="definition" seamless>
  <div>
<p><strong>Working directory</strong>: the root directory revision-controlled by Git (e.g., the directory in which the repo was initialized).</p></div></box>
<box type="definition" seamless>
  <div>
<p><strong>Commit</strong> (noun): a change (aka a <em>revision</em>) saved in the Git revision history.<br>
(verb): the act of creating a commit i.e., saving a change in the working directory into the Git revision history.</p></div></box>
<p>Here are the steps you can follow to learn how to work with Git commits:</p>
<p><strong>1. Do some changes to the content inside the <em>working directory</em></strong> e.g., create a file named <code v-pre>fruits.txt</code> in the <code v-pre>things</code> directory and add some dummy text to it.</p>
<p><strong>2. Observe how the file is detected by Git.</strong></p>
<tabs>
  <tab><template slot="_header">SourceTree</template>
    <div>
<p>The file is shown as ‘unstaged’</p>
<img src="/website/book/gitAndGithub/commit/images/sourcetree_1.png" height="220">
<p></p></div></tab>
  <tab class="algolia-no-index"><template slot="_header">CLI</template>
    <div>
<p>You can use the <code v-pre>git status</code> command to check the status of the working directory.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs sh" v-pre><span>git status<br></span></code></pre><p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-arrow-down"></span></span></p>
<pre><code class="hljs sh" v-pre><span><span class="hljs-comment"># On branch master</span><br></span><span><span class="hljs-comment">#</span><br></span><span><span class="hljs-comment"># Initial commit</span><br></span><span><span class="hljs-comment">#</span><br></span><span><span class="hljs-comment"># Untracked files:</span><br></span><span><span class="hljs-comment">#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)</span><br></span><span><span class="hljs-comment">#</span><br></span><span><span class="hljs-comment">#   a.txt</span><br></span><span>nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use <span class="hljs-string">"git add"</span> to track)<br></span></code></pre></div></tab></tabs>
<p><strong>3. Stage the changes to commit</strong>: Although Git has detected the file in the working directory, it will not do anything with the file unless you tell it to. Suppose you want to commit the current changes to the file. First, you should <em>stage</em> the file.</p>
<box type="definition" seamless>
  <div>
<p><strong>Stage</strong> (verb): Instructing Git to prepare a file for committing.</p></div></box>

<p></p></div></tab>
  <tab class="algolia-no-index"><template slot="_header">CLI</template>
    <div>
<p>Use the <code v-pre>commit</code> command to commit. The <code v-pre>-m</code> switch is used to specify the commit message.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs sh" v-pre><span>git commit -m <span class="hljs-string">"add fruits.txt"</span><br></span></code></pre><p>You can use the <code v-pre>log</code> command to see the commit history</p>

<p><strong>Note the existence of something called the <code v-pre>master</code> branch.</strong> Git allows you to have multiple branches (i.e. it is a way to evolve the content in parallel) and Git auto-creates a branch named <code v-pre>master</code> on which the commits go on by default.</p>
<p><strong>5. Do a few more commits</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do some changes to <code v-pre>fruits.txt</code> (e.g. add some text and delete some text). Stage the changes, and commit the changes using the same steps you followed before. You should end up with something like this.</p>
<img src="/website/book/gitAndGithub/commit/images/sourcetree_6.png" height="180">
<p></p></li>
<li>
<p>Next, add two more files <code v-pre>colors.txt</code> and <code v-pre>shapes.txt</code> to the same working directory. Add a third commit to record the current state of the working directory.</p>
<img src="/website/book/gitAndGithub/commit/images/sourcetree_7.png" height="150">
<p></p></li></ol>
<p><strong>6. See the revision graph:</strong>  Note how commits form a path-like structure aka the <em>revision tree/graph</em>. In the revision graph, each commit is shown as linked to its 'parent' commit (i.e., the commit before it).</p>
<tabs>
  <tab><template slot="_header">SourceTree</template>
<p>To see the revision graph, click on the <code v-pre>History</code> item on the menu on the right edge of SourceTree.

<p>Often, there are files inside the Git working folder that you don't want to revision-control e.g., temporary log files. Follow the steps below to learn how to configure Git to ignore such files.</p>
<p><strong>1. Add a file into your repo's working folder that you supposedly don't want to revision-control</strong> e.g., a file named <code v-pre>temp.txt</code>. Observe how Git has detected the new file.</p>
<p><strong>2. Tell Git to ignore that file:</strong></p>

<p>Observe that a file named <code v-pre>.gitignore</code> has been created in the working directory root and has the following line in it.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs" v-pre><span>temp.txt<br></span></code></pre></div></tab>
  <tab class="algolia-no-index"><template slot="_header">CLI</template>

<box>
<h5 id="the-ignore-file">The <code v-pre>.ignore</code> file<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#the-ignore-file" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h5>
<p>The <code v-pre>.gitignore</code> file tells Git which files to ignore when tracking revision history. That file itself can be either revision controlled or ignored.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To version control it (the more common choice – which allows you to track how the <code v-pre>.gitignore</code> file changed over time), simply commit it as you would commit any other file.</p></li>
<li>
<p>To ignore it, follow the same steps you followed above when you set Git to ignore the <code v-pre>temp.txt</code> file.</p></li>
<li>
<p>It supports file patterns e.g., adding <code v-pre>temp/*.tmp</code> to the <code v-pre>.gitignore</code> file prevents Git from tracking any <code v-pre>.tmp</code> file in the <code v-pre>temp</code> directory.</p></li></ul>

<p><strong>Git supports branching</strong> which allows you to do multiple parallel changes to the content of a repository.</p>
<p><strong>A Git branch is simply a <em>named label</em> pointing to a commit. The <code v-pre>HEAD</code> label indicates which branch you are on.</strong> Git creates a branch named <code v-pre>master</code> by default. When you add a commit, it goes into the branch you are currently on, and the branch label (together with the <code v-pre>HEAD</code> label) moves to the new commit.</p>

<li>A new branch <code v-pre>fix1</code> has been added. The repo has switched to the new branch too (hence, the <code v-pre>HEAD</code> label is attached to the <code v-pre>fix1</code> branch).</li>

<p><strong>7. Add another commit to the <code v-pre>feature1</code> branch.</strong></p>
<p><strong>8. Switch to the <code v-pre>master</code> branch and add one more commit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9. Merge <code v-pre>feature1</code> to the master branch</strong>, giving and end-result like this:</p>

<p><strong>10. Create a new branch called <code v-pre>add-countries</code>, switch to it, and add some commits to it</strong> <span class="dimmed">(similar to steps 1-2 above)</span>. You should have something like this now:</p>

<p><strong>11. Go back to the <code v-pre>master</code> branch and merge the <code v-pre>add-countries</code> branch onto the <code v-pre>master</code> branch</strong> <span class="dimmed">(similar to steps 8-9 above)</span>. While you might expect to see something like the below,</p>

<p></p>
<p>... you are likely to see something like this instead:</p>
<img src="/website/book/gitAndGithub/branch/images/addCountriesBranchAfterMerging.png" height="80">
<p></p>
<p>That is because <strong>Git does a <mark><em>fast forward</em> merge</mark> if possible</strong>. Seeing that the <code v-pre>master</code> branch has not changed since you started the <code v-pre>add-countries</code> branch, Git has decided it is simpler to just put the commits of the <code v-pre>add-countries</code> branch in front of the <code v-pre>master</code> branch, without going into the trouble of creating an extra merge commit.</p>

<p><strong>Merge conflicts happen when you try to combine two incompatible versions</strong> (e.g., merging a branch to another but each branch changed the same part of the code in a different way).</p>
<p>Here are the steps to simulate a merge conflict and use it to learn how to resolve merge conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>0. Create an empty repo or clone an existing repo</strong>, to be used for this activity.</p>
<p><strong>1. Start a branch named <code v-pre>fix1</code> in the repo. Create a commit</strong> that adds a line with some text to one of the files.</p>
<p><strong>2. Switch back to <code v-pre>master</code> branch. Create a commit with a conflicting change</strong> i.e. it adds a line with some different text in the exact location the previous line was added.</p>
<img src="/website/book/gitAndGithub/mergeConflicts/images/sourcetree_1.png" height="350">
<p></p>
<p><strong>3. Try to merge the <code v-pre>fix1</code> branch onto the <code v-pre>master</code> branch.</strong> Git will pause mid-way during the merge and report a merge conflict. If you open the conflicted file, you will see something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs" v-pre><span>COLORS<br></span><span>------<br></span><span>blue<br></span><span class="highlighted">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD<br></span><span>black<br></span><span class="highlighted">=======<br></span><span>green<br></span><span class="highlighted">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fix1<br></span><span>red<br></span><span>white<br></span></code></pre><p><strong>4. Observe how the conflicted part is marked</strong> between a line starting with <code v-pre>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; </code> and a line starting with <code v-pre>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, separated by another line starting with <code v-pre>=======</code>.</p>
<p>Highlighted below is the conflicting part that is coming from the <code v-pre>master</code> branch:</p>
<pre><code style="counter-reset: line 2;" class="hljs" v-pre><span>blue<br></span><span>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD<br></span><span class="highlighted">black<br></span><span>=======<br></span><span>green<br></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fix1<br></span><span>red<br></span></code></pre><p>This is the conflicting part that is coming from the <code v-pre>fix1</code> branch:</p>
<pre><code style="counter-reset: line 2;" class="hljs" v-pre><span>blue<br></span><span>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD<br></span><span>black<br></span><span>=======<br></span><span class="highlighted">green<br></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fix1<br></span><span>red<br></span></code></pre><p><strong>5. Resolve the conflict by editing the file</strong>. Let us assume you want to keep both lines in the merged version. You can modify the file to be like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs" v-pre><span>COLORS<br></span><span>------<br></span><span>blue<br></span><span class="highlighted">black<br></span><span class="highlighted">green<br></span><span>red<br></span><span>white<br></span></code></pre><p><strong>6. Stage the changes, and commit.</strong></p></div></div></div>

<p><strong>A <mark><em>pull request</em></mark> (PR for short) is mechanism for contributing code to a remote repo.</strong> i.e., &quot;I'm <em>requesting</em> you to <em>pull</em> my proposed changes to your repo&quot;. For this to work, the two repos must have a shared history. The most common case is sending PRs from a fork to its <span data-mb-component-type="tooltip" v-b-tooltip.hover.top.html="tooltipInnerContentGetter" class="trigger"><span data-mb-html-for="_content"><em>upstream</em> repo is a repo you forked from</span>upstream</span> repo.</p></div></b-modal>

<ul>
<li><strong>Option A - Commit changes to the <code v-pre>master</code> branch</strong></li>
<li><strong>Option B - Commit to a new branch</strong> e.g., create a branch named <code v-pre>add-intro</code> (remember to switch to the <code v-pre>master</code> branch before creating a new branch) and add your commit to it.</li></ul>

<li>
<p>Go to the receiving repo to verify your PR appears there in the <code v-pre>Pull requests</code> tab.
</p></li></ol></span><p></p>


<p><strong>The next step of the PR life cycle is the PR <em>review</em>.</strong> The members of the repo that received your PR can now review your proposed changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>If they like the changes, they can <em>merge</em> the changes to their repo, which also closes the PR automatically.</li>
<li>If they don't like it at all, they can simply close the PR too i.e., they reject your proposed change.</li>
<li>In most cases, they will add comments to the PR to suggest further changes. When that happens, GitHub will notify you.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You can update the PR along the way too.</strong> Suppose PR reviewers suggested a certain improvement to your proposed code. To update your PR as per the suggestion, you can simply modify the code in your local repo, commit the updated code to the same <code v-pre>master</code> branch, and push to your fork as you did earlier. The PR will auto-update accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Sending PRs using the <code v-pre>master</code> branch is less common</strong> than sending PRs using separate branches. For example, suppose you wanted to propose two bug fixes that are not related to each other. In that case, it is more appropriate to send two separate PRs so that each fix can be reviewed, refined, and merged independently. But if you send PRs using the <code v-pre>master</code> branch only, both fixes (and any other change you do in the <code v-pre>master</code> branch) will appear in the PRs you create from it.</p>
<p><strong>To create another PR</strong> while the current PR is still under review, create a new branch (remember to <mark>switch back to the <code v-pre>master</code> first</mark>), add your new proposed change in that branch, and create a new PR following the steps given above.</p>
<p><strong>It is possible to create PRs within the same repo</strong> e.g., you can create a PR from branch <code v-pre>feature-x</code> to the <code v-pre>master</code> branch, within the same repo. Doing so will allow the code to be reviewed by other developers (using PR review mechanism) before it is merged.</p>
